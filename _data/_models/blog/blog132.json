  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Amid downtown St. Helena&rsquo;s independent boutiques, Michelin-starred restaurants, and wine country hospitality lies a rich history often overlooked when visiting this quaint Napa Valley town. The St. Helena Historic Commercial District spans over 83-acres and includes 34 buildings, many of which are now protected on the National Register of Historic Places. From a neighborhood saloon to colonial revival storefronts, there are many places to admire on this self-guided walking tour of the St. Helena Historic District.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Starting at the<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pritchard+Building/@38.5053456,-122.4703475,17.15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x70d4a1b56601e60e!8m2!3d38.5059061!4d-122.4698541\"> intersection of Adams Street and Railroad Avenue</a>, you&rsquo;ll find the grand Pritchard Building constructed of dressed and cut stone. The 1906 building was once a feed mill and warehouse, then subsequently a skating rink and bus depot. The building now houses a variety of independent businesses.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Head west towards Main Street and take a left for a jaunt down historic Main Street.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a few minutes of walking, you&rsquo;ll spot the 1882 Richie Block building on your right, arguably the most prominent building on all of Main Street. The Napa Valley Masonic Lodge operates out of its second floor while various shops occupy the street level storefronts. Across the street is the Caldwell Snyder contemporary art gallery housed in the small Second Renaissance Revival Star Building built in 1900.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just past the gallery you&rsquo;ll see a beautiful brick and stone building built for banker Daniel O. Hunt in 1891. Regarded as one of St. Helena&rsquo;s most highly esteemed citizens, Hunt took an interest in the development of the community. Together with his wife Clara A. Blodgett, founder and first president of the Woman&rsquo;s Improvement Club of St. Helena, this power couple helped put St. Helena on the map.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next door to the Hunt Building is Cook St. Helena, a popular petite eatery that is a favorite amongst locals. Before serving up locally sourced Italian cuisine, this restaurant was home to a saloon in the early 19th and 20th centuries.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Across the street is the Hotel St. Helena, the Italianate wood-frame building constructed for hotelier Swen Alstrom in 1881. This European-style boutique hotel was the last large wooden building constructed in downtown. Make your way past the beautiful Ana&rsquo;s Cantina and Acres Home and Garden shop with their facade treatment dating back to 1940.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continue exploring St. Helena&rsquo;s historic downtown as you walk down Main Street and pass Italianate brick buildings and various storefronts from the 1880s.
