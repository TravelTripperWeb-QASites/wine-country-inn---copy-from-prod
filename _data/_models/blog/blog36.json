  "long_description": "<p>If you like Contemporary Art, March is a fantastic month to be in Manhattan! The Armory Show is here and so are the satellite art fairs. We know it can get overwhelming trying to navigate the exhibitions, so here is our cheat sheet:</p><p><u>THE ARMORY SHOW</u></p><p>Number one show you need to visit to see International Blue Chip Art Galleries. Come check out the 209 exhibitors and expect to see Gagosian, White Cube, and many more. By far, the best the presentation of world famous contemporary artists. Hosted at Pier 94 and Pier 92 on the Hudson, it's on the west side, but there are shuttles traveling to and from the satellite fairs.</p><p><i> The Armory Show, 711 12th Avenue at 55th Street, Pier 94 and Pier 92</i> </p><p><u>VOLTA NY</u></p><p>This is the Armory's sister fair and we love it because of it's curatorial approach to picking exhibitors. Each gallery exhibits just one artist, making it smaller and easier to digest than the bigger fairs. Panel discussions will be held daily by artnet and are not to be missed.</p><p><i> Volta NY, March 1-5, Pier 90</i> </p><p><u>INDEPENDENT</u></p><p>Definitely the most hip of the art shows. This year focuses on five themes: 1980's generation artists, work from the 1970's, intergenerational groupings, site-specific installations, and solo shows by women artist. Come by to check out over 50 exhibitors from 20 countries and rub elbow with the coolest and most fashionable in New York City. </p><p><i> Independent, March 3-5, Spring Studios, 50 Varick Street </i> </p>"
