A light lunch of assorted deli sandwiches, fresh fruit, salad, and a small dessert will be served during a delicious garden lunch break at one of the wineries. Platypus has been known to be accommodating for lunch menu options, offering picnic items for all dietary preferences if requested beforehand. Not only will a tasty picnic lunch be provided, but bottled water and an artisanal cheese platter will also be served on the shuttle.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Visit Boutique Wineries</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No Platypus Wine Tour is ever the same, so it&rsquo;s a surprise which smaller, intimate wineries will be on your itinerary for the day. Expect four wineries rich in history, many being family-owned, and all guaranteed to give you the VIP treatment. The ever-changing selection of boutique wineries may include Silenus Winery, Madrigal Family Winery, Provenance Vineyards, Razi Winery, and Hans Fahden Vineyards to name a few.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wine tasting fees are not included, but average at around $15 per person, and almost all wineries will waive the fee with the purchase of a bottle. Visits typically last one hour, including a tasting, tour, and maybe even a peak in the wine caves.
