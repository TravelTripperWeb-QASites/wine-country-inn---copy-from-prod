  "long_description": "<p>Where can you go to buy a side table for your bedroom, a onesie for your nephew, vintage glasses for your collector boyfriend and grab a delicious bite to eat while you're at it? Easy, the answer is Brooklyn Flea + Smorgasbord. Since 2008, the market's been host to hundreds of vendors of everything from jewelry to antiques and artisanal local food, and has since been ranked as one of the best markets in the U.S. by Travel + Leisure. Arrive early, as it can get crowded, and allow yourself time to wander the aisles admiring the talent of local artists and designers. Then, head over to the food section for a famous ramen burger or some beer-battered fish tacos. In the colder months, the market moves into Industry City, just a short train ride away from our Times Square hotel, then in April moves to its outdoor Sunday location in Williamsburg.</p> <br> <p>Address: 241 37th St, Brooklyn, NY 11232, USA</p>"
