  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Located in the heart of the Napa Valley wine region, the city of Napa is full of activities for you and your dog to enjoy together. Take a scenic stroll along the Napa River, behold downtown&rsquo;s late 1800s architecture, or shop, dine, and enjoy a wine tasting, all in the company of your four-legged friend. Make the town of Napa a destination on your wine country vacation with these dog-friendly festivities.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Alston Park</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Begin your day at Alston Park, a nature preserve with over 30 acres of dog-friendly hiking trails and spaces. Take the easy trail loop with your pup to overlook Napa&rsquo;s rolling hills and distant vineyards. After a nice walk, end your visit at Canine Commons, a 3-acre fenced in grassy dog playground within the park. If you have a smaller dog, there is an adjacent area where they can play with ones their own size. The playgrounds are equipped with agility equipment, dog waste bags, and plenty of water and shade. There are several benches to sit while you watch dogs mingle. Morning in the park is the perfect time for bird watching, cooler temperatures, and less of a crowd.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alston+Park/@38.3269442,-122.3405105,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x4ed1c76675b346b?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEp7yT963bAhUPJnwKHfpQArAQ_BIIezAK\"> 2037 Dry Creek Road, Napa</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Ang&egrave;le Restaurant and Bar</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now that your dog is tired from frolicking in the park, it&rsquo;s time for some grub. Head to Ang&egrave;le Restaurant and Bar in downtown for some rustic French fare. People-watch along the Napa River and have a meal with your pup on their riverfront terrace. The French country restaurant is located in a historic 1890s ship chandlery and serves up refined bistro fare with wine and specialty cocktails. Their French classics are delectable. Try the escargots in a light puff pastry with a delicious pesto butter or the mussels in a light spicy saffron sauce. Any of the freshly caught fish is always cooked to perfection over a bed of fresh vegetables. And they have one of the best bread puddings smothered in a delicious bourbon sauce.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Angele+Restaurant+%26+Bar/@38.295963,-122.2826819,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xd99f59aef9acc58!8m2!3d38.295963!4d-122.2826819\">540 Main Street, Napa</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After lunch is the perfect time to explore the streets of downtown Napa. Take the Napa River Walk north until you come to Oxbow Public Market, a sprawling marketplace featuring food and wine vendors, local produce, and more. Pups aren&rsquo;t allowed inside, but there are dog-friendly areas along their riverside deck.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Clos du Val Winery</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After your long day on the town, drive north along Silverado Trail until you reach Clos du Val. What sets this winery apart is that your dog is allowed to accompany you in the tasting room as well as on their grounds. Clos du Val was put on the map when their Cabernet Sauvignon was selected for the famous 1976 Judgment of Paris tasting. Situated in the historic Stags Leap District, you can taste their estate-grown wines on their sprawling picnic grounds complete with a beautiful olive grove. Try one of their reds, which are known for their impeccable balance, complexity, and vivid fruit. We recommend the Pinot Noir, with aromas of chocolate, raspberry, and strawberry, and bold flavors of red fruits.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Clos+Du+Val/@38.3872129,-122.3127035,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xacf2fbde6204aef6?sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi58aaEnq7bAhVhllQKHV-FDOgQ_BIIzAEwEw\"> 5330 Silverado Trail, Napa</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9af02724-bdd8-2b14-591d-052d49a547e6\">After your day out on the town with your pup, unwind at the Wine Country Inn and Cottages, a dog-friendly authentic Napa Valley boutique inn, and take advantage of our special <a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/offers/pet-agree/\">Pet Agree Package</a>, now for a limited time.</span></em></p>",
