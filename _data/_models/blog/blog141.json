After exploring exceptional<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/fine-dining-st-helena/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> St. Helena cuisine</a>, take the short drive south to the little town of Yountville, home to some of Napa Valley&rsquo;s finest wineries and restaurants. Here are the best places for fine dining in the charming town of Yountville.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Bistro Jeanty</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For fine French food in a classic, comfortable bistro setting, visit<a href=\"http://www.bistrojeanty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Bistro Jeanty</a> on Yountville&rsquo;s quaint Washington Street. Award-winning Chef Philippe Jeanty opened his French country fare restaurant more than 20 years ago in hopes of recreating the favorite foods of his childhood. Born in the Champagne region of France, Chef Jeanty brings regional homey French cuisine to Napa Valley. Indulge in French classics like Escargot, Steak tartare, Coq au Vin, and Boeuf Bourguignon with short ribs, roasted carrots, and pearl onions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The French Laundry</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is no other restaurant in all of Napa Valley that has received as much accolades as the world renowned,<a href=\"https://www.thomaskeller.com/tfl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> The French Laundry</a>. Named &lsquo;Best Restaurant in the World&rsquo; by Restaurant Magazine, awarded three stars in the Michelin Guide to San Francisco, and dubbed &ldquo;the best restaurant in the world, period&rdquo; by Anthony Bourdain, The French Laundry is a must stop for any fine cuisine connoisseur.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chef Thomas Keller never repeats a single ingredient in his menu, instead giving you the element of surprise in a series of small courses meant to &ldquo;excite your mind, satisfy your appetite, and pique your curiosity.&rdquo; Expect menu items like caviar, seasonal salads, and local meats and seafood, all with exquisite and innovative pairings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The French Laundry is located in a charming stone farmhouse, originally built as a saloon in 1900 by a Scottish stonemason and now on the National Register of Historic Places. For more historic Napa Valley architecture, take a walking tour of the<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/st-helena-historic-district/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> St. Helena Historic District</a>, only a few miles from the Wine Country Inn and Suites.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Bouchon Bistro</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adding to Yountville&rsquo;s fine French cuisine scene,<a href=\"https://www.thomaskeller.com/bouchonyountville\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Bouchon Bistro</a> is another one of Chef Thomas Keller&rsquo;s creations. Opening only four years after The French Laundry, this French bistro serves up traditional fare with a seasonal menu, fresh raw bar, and their <em>Vin de carafe</em> wine program that brings recognition to local wine producers. Year-round favorites from this Michelin-starred eatery include roast chicken, leg of lamb, and trout amandine.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Redd</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pulling culinary influences from Asia, Europe, and Mexico,<a href=\"http://reddnapavalley.com/dinnermenu.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Redd&rsquo;s menu</a> is a mash-up of ethnic influence with a California twist. Founder/Chef Richard Reddington created a menu that reflects his epicurean travels around the world housed in a quintessential California contemporary space. Dine in their elegant dining room at tables inspired by sample worktables employed at the Valley&rsquo;s vineyards or on their outdoor courtyard shaded by olive trees looking out over Napa Valley. Try the duck breast with heirloom beans, radish, cipollini onion, chorizo, and duck mole for a flavor profile rich in Latin culinary influence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Bottega Napa Valley</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bringing together Italian and California cuisine,<a href=\"https://www.botteganapavalley.com/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Chef Michael Chiarello</a> has prepared a menu worthy of its &lsquo;Top 10&rsquo; award by Forbes. Serving up rustic Italian fare like pasta, cured meats, fresh cheeses, and an extensive wine list of local and Italian vintages, Chef Chiarello fuses his traditional family recipes with California inspiration. Visit the historic winery estate and indulge in cuisine created by the Emmy award-winning chef. For a classic Italian dish, try the Pasta Fritta con Prosciutto, with Cabernet stained crispy Italian bread served with house cured prosciutto, sparkling Lambrusco wine, and sliced butter pears.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><a href=\"https://res.windsurfercrs.com/ibe/index.aspx?propertyID=14513&amp;_ga=2.115605830.1381539916.1532791779-362558771.1531333773&amp;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Book your Napa Valley vacation</a> with the Wine Country Inn and Suites, located only a short drive north of Yountville in the charming town of St. Helena.</em></p>",
