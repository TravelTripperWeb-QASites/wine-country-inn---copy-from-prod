  "long_description": "<p>Take a break from the 21st century cosmopolitan hustle and bustle of New York City with an escape to The Cloisters, a museum dedicated to showcasing the wonders of the Medieval period through its art, architecture and gardens. Part of the wonder of this abby-inspired museum, is in its origins and construction, which took place in the 1910s. Incorporating pieces from different European abbeys, museum designer Charles Collens had the original structures dismantled by hand and the materials brought over to New York. Here, the abbeys were reconstructed and integrated into one building, resulting in a unique convergence of different architectural styles, and has since become of one New York City's most treasured landmarks. The Cloisters is home to nearly five thousand medieval works of art, including paintings, ivory statuettes of English and French origins, Flemish tapestries as well as illuminated books and texts. Located in Fort Tyron Park, overlooking the Hudson River, the museum grounds are as much as reflection of the medieval period as the main building. The gardens were planted following information found in contemporary horticulture manuscripts, and include several cloistered herb gardens. The museum itself is relatively small, especially when compared to other museums in the city, but a tour of its carefully constructed and furnished interiors, the well-kept courtyard and remainder of the grounds are an unbeatable experience and peek into the Middle Ages. On your next stay at our Times Square hotel, dedicate a morning to a medieval escape, in the Washington Heights section of Upper Manhattan. Take advantage of the warmer days and pack a picnic lunch to enjoy on the grounds of Fort Tyron Park, with an unparalleled view of the Hudson River.</p> <br> <p>Address: 99 Margaret Corbin Dr, New York, NY 10040</p>"
