The historic building was the first winery in Napa Valley to open after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933. Try their 2012 Profile red blend with aromas of dark sweet cherry, black currant, plum, spice, toast, and dried herbs. The sweetness of the fruit notes are accentuated by notes of red currant, green tea, dried rose petals, toffee, and tobacco. The Antigua dessert wine is also a crowd-pleaser, with complex nut and orange-peel aromas that highlight the subtleties from the fine brandy and time spent in French oak barrels. Reservations are not required.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Only a two-minute walk from Merryvale Vineyards is the ultra popular<a href=\"http://www.longmeadowranch.com/eat-drink/restaurant\"> Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch</a> restaurant.
