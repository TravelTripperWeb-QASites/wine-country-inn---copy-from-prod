  "short_description": "<p>You've been admiring those miniature masterpieces inside of your favorite box of treats for long enough--time to flex your creativity. Take a chocolate making class at Tache, an artisan handmade store in the Lower East Side. Bring a friend or your family and kids for a fun packed day of learning and creating. By the end of the lesson you will have made several bags of chocolate to take home. You will also learn everything from cultivating, to tasting, to tempering, to coating and to decorating. Make exciting designs like chocolate mustache lollipops, red juicy lips, or caramel kisses. After the class you will sample scrumptious spiced cider or hot cocoa. We can't think of a better way to spend a cold winter's day in Manhattan. It's around the corner for the Tenement Museum, so for extra fun and education we suggest doing the class early and then checking out the museum.</p> <p> <i> Tache, 254 Broome (right around the corner from the Tenement Museum between Orchard & Ludlow) <a href=\"http://www.tachechocolate.com/classes\" target=\"_blank\" > www.tachechocolate.com/classes </a> </i> </p> "
