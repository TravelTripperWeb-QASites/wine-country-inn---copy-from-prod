  "long_description": "<p>Off-the-beaten path but not far from perfection! The Tenement Museum is an interactive experience that can be viewed three ways. The first is to tour the building of restored apartments, past businesses, residents and merchants from a variety of time periods. The second is the most innovative--meet the residents, these are costumed interpreters that are acting out the daily life of the people that lived at 97 Orchard Street. The third is to walk the neighborhood and acquaint yourself with the contributions to culture that the immigrants pioneered. All of the tours are guided and provide a different eye-opening perspective. Take a step back in time and learn about the struggles of the past. It's America's first urban living-history museum dedicated to the lives of immigrants. We suggest the Irish Outsiders Tour for a detailed and informative experience.  </p> <p> <i> Lower East Side Tenement Museum, 103 Orchard St, New York, NY 100002, 212-982-8420, <a href=\"http://www.tenement.org/\" target=\"_blank\" > http://www.tenement.org/ </a> </i> </p> "
