  "long_description": "<p>Coming up in October, New York City will come alive with glowing pumpkins, spiced lattes, and eerie tales of one of the most influential cities in America. Don't miss out on the several festive occasions throughout Manhattan and its surrounding areas this year! The NYC tradition in this post is one of our favorites. </p> <p> Every Halloween, The Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine puts on a show to make even the most seasoned horror-lovers scream. Each year, the church screens a classic horror film alongside creepy, live music from the church's organ. On October 28th, the Cathedral will be putting on The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari from 1920, with organ music by Timothy Brumfield. </p> <p> After the show, Ralph Lee's Mettawee River Theater Company takes the stage for tricks and treats. Encounter demons, witches, ghosts, and ghouls as they interact with the audience, frightening and cackling their way through the night.</p> "
