  "long_description": "<p>As we all know, the First of November marks the date where it is officially a-ok to break out your Santa hats, drink gingerbread lattes, and start playing \"Jingle Bells\" in your car. The Radio City Christmas Spectacular has just the thing for all you Christmas-lovers, and it starts this November 11th. </p><p> Since 1933, the Christmas Spectacular has been a staple in the New York holiday season. Iconic, fun, and expertly choreographed, this show will have you on the edge of your seat, so visit Radio City Music Hall at Rockefeller Center and let the Rockettes take you on a journey like no other. Reindeer, candy canes, toy soldiers, and a jolly old man named Santa all have a place in this wonderful show, and it will no doubt refresh that elusive holiday spirit we wait all year to feel once again. </p><p> Reserve your tickets at the Rockettes' website. You won't regret the experience!</p> "
