  "long_description": "<p>On September 18th, Fort Tryon Park goes back in time with the Medieval Festival, twenty minutes away from the Manhattan at Times Square Hotel.</p> <p>Great for kids and adults alike, the Medieval Festival has a little something for all history lovers. Cheer on your favorite swordsman or monk during the duels and jousting tournaments. But if you want to avoid the more violent events, bring your kids to the Unicorn Forum, where tales of dragons and faeries entertain between bouts of traditional Irish music. Children are even invited to partake in the children's parade at four in the evening, so don't miss out!</p> <p>In between tournaments, browse the markets for souvenirs, face painting, and crafts by artisan medieval lovers. For a complete experience, grab your lunch and dinner at one of the many pubs or food stands around the Fort before heading back to your bed at the Manhattan.</p>"
