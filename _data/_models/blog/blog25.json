  "long_description": "<p>Some of the best things about New York City are its unending subcultures. From hipsters to old money, the neighborhoods of New York have a little something for everyone. There's even a specific museum for those tourists who are into not-so-traditional art. Perhaps the best time to visit one of NYC's creepiest museums is this October, just in time for Halloween.</p><p>The Morbid Anatomy Museum, which opened recently in 2009, provides some of the most intriguing art exhibits and lectures Brooklyn has to offer. Until November 6th, one of the most anticipated taxidermy collections, Walter Potter's Kittens' Wedding, is on display. The museum also puts on special walking tours through Brooklyn, inspired by H.P. Lovecraft or Mexico's Day of the Dead.</p> <p>Focusing on taxidermy, death, rats, and anything else that might make you squirm, the Morbid Anatomy Museum is a unique experience you won't want to miss.</p> "
