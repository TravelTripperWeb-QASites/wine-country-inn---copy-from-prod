  "long_description": "<p>The cherry blossoms are in full bloom which means two things to any New Yorker: the end to months of layering and heavy coats, and the annual Brooklyn Botanic Garden's cherry blossom festival. Sakura Matsuri, or cherry blossom festivals, have long been an important tradition in Japanese culture, and has been celebrated by the BBG for 35 years as an official welcoming of spring. This year, the celebration falls on the weekend of Saturday, April 30. This weekend-long event celebrates traditional and contemporary Japanese culture, with over 60 events and performances for all ages, just a short train ride from our Times Square hotel. Stop by on Saturday for a traditional Tea Ceremony or to catch the thunderous taiko drumming and martial arts demonstrations. If you want to nurture your green thumb, don't miss Sunday's bonsai and flower arrangement events. For the little ones, you'll find origami, drawing and other activities. Celebrate the arrival of spring and the beauty of Japanese culture amidst the symbolic cherry blossoms.</p> <br> <p>990 Washington Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11225</p>"
