  "long_description": "<p>We've mentioned some of what the famous High Line Park in NYC has to offer before, but we haven't gotten to talk about some of the other amazing opportunities and tours that set off from that location. The High Line, an elevated train track converted into one of the United State's most unique parks, is located only a ten minute drive from our hotel in Times Square.</p> <p>For our history buffs, a tour is the best option to learn about the growing communities in the city and the story of how the High Line evolved from its violent past to become one of the best attractions NYC has to offer. Previously known to contribute to \"Death Avenue\" because of train's frequent accidents, the park now has stunning greenery and exceptional safety. Let your local guide lead your family through the park and point out which neighborhoods have changed over the years and why. Learn about the gentrification, repurposing, and overall evolution of Manhattan's West Side from this one in a million perspective. </p> <p>If you're more of a night owl, try out the sightseeing cruise and bus tour that takes place at 5:30 pm. Enjoy four solid hours of walking, driving, sightseeing, cruising, and champagne drinking on the deck of a cruise boat in the Hudson River. Start off the tour on the ground before you make your way up to the High Line, then cruise your way out to the towering and impressive Statue of Liberty while the sun sets. End your tour with a drive through some of New York City's most famous locations, such as SoHo, Greenwich Village, Grand Central Station, and Chinatown. </p> <p> Whichever time of day you experience your tour, you'll head back to your room at the Manhattan knowing you saw New York City in a fresh and exciting way. Make sure to try out some of the local treats along the stretch if you have some time to kill. </p> <br> <p>Address: The High Line, between 10th and 12th Avenues, New York City</p>"
