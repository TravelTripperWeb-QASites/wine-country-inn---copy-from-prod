From an in-house symphony orchestra to intimate poetry nights, experience the culture of the Napa Valley through this world-class venue&rsquo;s performing arts and entertainment.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The Lincoln Theatre</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nearly five decades after its creation in 1957, the Lincoln Theatre underwent a $22 million renovation in 2005 to become the multi-purpose non-profit venue that it is today. When arriving to the theatre on the historic grounds of the Veterans Home of California, allow extra time to stroll their tree-lined property to observe trees from all over the world. The spacious lobby of the Lincoln Theatre is the perfect place to grab a glass of sparkling wine and view the towering ceiling, windows, and elegant spiral staircase of the Grand Foyer before your show begins. You&rsquo;ll find that there isn&rsquo;t a bad seat in this intimate 1,200-seat venue. After your show, take a walk through the town of Yountville, located just on the other side of St. Helena Highway and home to some of the world&rsquo;s most prestigious<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/best-fine-dining-restaurants-in-yountville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> fine dining eateries</a>.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Symphony Napa Valley</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Listen to the newly formed<a href=\"http://symphonynv.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Symphony Napa Valley</a> under the directorship of Grammy-nominated and youngest violinist ever admitted to the Brussels Royal Conservatory, Michael Guttman. Made up of some of the best professional musicians in Northern California, Symphony Napa Valley serves as the in-house orchestra for performances at the Lincoln Theatre. Ranging in size from a quartet to a large-scale orchestra, Symphony Napa Valley regularly welcomes guest conductors and performers on stage. The Symphony also maintains its own Artists in Residence Program, delivering art education for up-and-coming professionals and graduate students in the areas of music, theater, writing, and dance.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">2018 Events</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Still to come this season, the 4th annual National Cowboy Music and Poetry Gathering returns to the Lincoln Theatre, honoring the valley&rsquo;s strong ties to the land with a glimpse into the lives and traditions of American ranchers through song and poetry. For another historical throwback, attend a showing of <em>In the Mood</em>, now in its 25th season of touring. The &ldquo;retro extravaganza&rdquo; transports the audience back in time to the 30s and 40s for a swing era music and dance performance with a little comedy, romance, and high energy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continuing Lincoln Theatre&rsquo;s nostalgic lineup, throw on your best 1920s fashion for Great Gatsby Casino Night.
