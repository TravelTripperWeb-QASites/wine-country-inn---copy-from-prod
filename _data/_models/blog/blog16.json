  "long_description": "<p>For those who like their nights out to be a little more complex or exciting, New York City is known for its many \"secret bars.\" No night out to a speakeasy would be complete without a fancy outfit, a secret password, and a healthy dose of self-consciousness as you wait to be admitted. Let us suggest the classy and polite speakeasy Please Don't Tell, located about twenty minutes from the Manhattan at Times Square Hotel via subway. </p><p>Enter through the phone booth just outside the building to step back into the refined style of New York's Prohibition Era. After you're admitted, take in the beautiful and authentic decorationsâ€”from the exposed brick to the stuffed deer, raccoon, and bear mounted on the walls. No speakeasy would be complete without a set of rules to keep the atmosphere strictly twenties-esque. Some of those rules include asking guests to refrain from making or taking phone calls, engaging in heavy or obnoxious PDA, and making sure each guest's positive experience is ensured by other guests sharing the bar. </p><p>Please Don't Tell is more concerned with providing guests with a unique experience than fitting in with the rest of New York's nightlife. So, if you're looking for a way to meet up with strangers or a place to get a little wild, Please Don't Tell is not for you. Classy, fun, and first and foremost about the experience, Please Don't Tell is unlike any other bar you've been to. </p><p>Not to mention, Please Don't Tell has amazing food and unique beverages to better your experience. Try one of their many signature hotdogs, with flavors from Pok Pok to Kimchi, or order a more refined drink, such as the Peanut Butter Cup or Java the Hut, before you head out the way you came. </p><p>When you're done, it might be time to head back to the Manhattan at Times Square Hotel, or you could spend more time out in the city that never sleeps. There is always something to see here. </p><p>Address: Please Don't Tell, 113 Saint Marks Place, New York, NY 10009</p>"
