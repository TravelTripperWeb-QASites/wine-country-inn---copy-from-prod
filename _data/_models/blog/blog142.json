Here are five of wine country&rsquo;s most historic wineries that have survived the test of time.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Charles Krug Winery</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the oldest winery in Napa Valley, Charles Krug Winery opened its doors in 1882 and has continued producing exceptional wines for more than 150 years. Acquiring the winery from Krug in 1943, the Mondavi family continues to preserve Charles Krug&rsquo;s vision. Visit the 147-acre winery in St. Helena and take a tour of the historic estate and famous Redwood Cellar as you learn about Napa Valley pioneers Charles Krug and the Mondavi family. The intimate tour includes stories about the founders&rsquo; contributions to the wine industry and the storied heritage of this historic estate. For a broad overview of Napa Valley&rsquo;s winemaking history, take a<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/napa-river-history-kayak-tour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> kayak tour</a> along the Napa River for an exciting way to see wine country.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Inglenook</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Established in 1879 by Finnish sea captain Gustave Niebaum, Inglenook now belongs to American film director Francis Coppola. After purchasing the property in 1975, Coppola and his wife Eleanor restored all winemaking operations to the Rutherford chateau, from agriculture to bottling. Visit the historic property and take heed of the newly renovated historic water storage tank house that was converted into the main entrance Visitor Center.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Schramsberg Vineyards</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jacob Schram established his winery on the Napa Valley mountainside in the 1870s and was among the first to use hillside caves for wine-aging and storage. Acquired by Jack and Jamie Davies in 1965, Schramsberg Vineyards has continued to produce world-class sparkling wines for decades, including their <em>Blanc de Blancs</em>. This wine is the first commercial use of Chardonnay in American sparkling wine and has been served at official State functions by every U.S. Presidential administration since the 1970s. Visit the 19th century Victorian mansion and underground cellars in Calistoga.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Beringer Vineyards</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">German immigrant brothers Jacob and Frederick Beringer purchased 215 acres of Napa Valley land in 1875 and built their dream from the ground up. Over 140 years later, Beringer Vineyards is California&rsquo;s oldest continually operating winery and among the first to use hand-dug cellars. The entire St. Helena estate was designated a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. Do a tasting in the 1884 Rhine House, Frederick&rsquo;s former residence and a nod to ornate Victorian architecture with its stonework, stained-glass windows, and interior wood paneling. For more St. Helena history, take a<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/st-helena-historic-district/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> walking tour</a> through nearby downtown after an afternoon spent touring Beringer Vineyards.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Freemark Abbey</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Freemark Abbey is one of twelve United States wineries chosen to compete in the famous 1976 <em>Judgment of Paris</em> blind tasting and the only winery to have submitted a red and white wine. Named after its three founders, Freemark Abbey is one of the first Napa Valley wineries to have a female winery owner on record. Visit their 130-year-old legacy in St. Helena, complete with a wine library with vintages dating to the 1960s.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Other Historic Napa Valley Wineries You Must Visit</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are many incredible historic wineries throughout Napa Valley.
