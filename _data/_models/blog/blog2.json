  "long_description": "<p>Feel like disrobing for a cause? This Valentine's Day, do-gooders with a distinct lack of shame can take part in Cupid's Undie Run, a one-mile run that takes participants through the streets to the Brass Monkey Bar and was conceived to raise funds for the Children's Tumor Foundation. The catch? You have to be in your underwear. Participants have stretched just what that means over the years with fun and ridiculous costumes. Even if you don't participate, it's worth checking out just to watch and see what people show up dressed in (or not dressed in). But why not help a good cause this Valentine's Day and strip down into your skivvies? At least you know there's good food and drinks waiting at the end of it!</p> <br> <p> Address: 605 W 48th St, New York City </p> "
