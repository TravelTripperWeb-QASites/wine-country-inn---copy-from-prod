So kick off your shoes and jump into a barrel of Napa Valley terroir grapes. It&rsquo;s time to get stomping.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Attend a Grgich Hills Estate Grape Stomp</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No other winery in Napa Valley does a traditional grape stomp quite like Grgich Hills Estate. Every year, the Rutherford winery throws a daily stomp soir&eacute;e stretching the entire length of harvest season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Begin this year&rsquo;s season at their annual <em>Blessing of the Grapes</em> bash for a toast to the harvest with a glass of wine and cheese pairing. The tradition of blessing the grapes before harvest season dates back to the Old Testament. The time-honored celebration has been continued at Grgich Hills Estate since 1977. Stick around after the blessing for the first grape crush of the season followed by an outside reception on the patio.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://grgich.com/events/napa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grgich Hills Estate</a> grape stomps are held daily through October and include a tasting of three estate wines and a souvenir &ldquo;I stomped at Grgich Hills&rdquo; t-shirt with your red-stained footprints to take home.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Where Else to Stomp Away</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also in Rutherford, Peju Province Winery is hosting their<em><a href=\"http://www.peju.com/experience/events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&nbsp;Grape Stomp</a></em> competition complete with a delicious Farm-to-Table lunch. Grab a partner and come dressed in your best team shirts for a chance to win a commemorative <em>Peju Grape Stomp</em> prize. Named the &ldquo;Best Event in the Napa Valley&rdquo; by the San Francisco Examiner, the<a href=\"https://www.schweigervineyards.com/Experience-Schweiger-Vineyards/Events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Schweiger Vineyards <em>Grape Stomp</em></a> has two dates this year. Hosted by winemakers Fred and Andy Schweiger, you will have the opportunity to pick and stomp your own grapes. Enjoy the fruits of your labor with a lunch and Schweiger wines on the terrace.

Although the image of lasting purple feet may dissuade you from getting your feet wet, stompers are not in the grape juice long enough to get stained feet. The wineries all provide water and towels. Wearing shorts or a skirt is ideal, but if you must wear pants, make sure they are comfortable and can be rolled up. Much of the day will be spent outside, so sunscreen is essential. And don&rsquo;t worry, after your grape crushing, the stomped grapes and juice go right back into the vineyard, not into the next wine batch!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-b26cf656-7fff-efa1-4baf-d9b387c04f24\">After a day of stomping, put your feet up at the Wine Country Inn. Book your<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/offers/napa-valley-getaway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Napa Valley Getaway</a> for a split of local wine and culinary bites in your room upon arrival, weekend wine tasting hosted by a local vintner, luxurious guest rooms, and a wine country breakfast served each morning.</span></em></p>",
