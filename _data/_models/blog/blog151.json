Visit the valley&rsquo;s first church, the final resting place of famous Napa Valley pioneers at Pioneer Cemetery, and the 36-foot gristmill. The water-powered gristmill, now a historic landmark, was built in 1846 for early settlers to turn their corn and wheat into meal or flour. Stop by on a weekend for milling demonstrations and tours.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bale Grist Mill is also featured in our<em><a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/dog-friendly-hiking-trails-napa-valley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Dog Friendly Hiking Trails of Napa Valley</a></em> guide, as a fun place to bring your four-legged friend.

Guests are even permitted to bring a bottle of wine to enjoy in the park&rsquo;s shady day use area. After a day outside, hop on the Calistoga Shuttle from the Bothe Visitor&rsquo;s Center to travel to downtown Calistoga to explore the<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/best-mineral-hot-springs-in-the-napa-valley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> historic hot springs town</a>.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=472\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Robert Louis Stevenson State Park</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The park gets its namesake from the author of<em> Treasure Island</em> and <em>Kidnapped</em>, who spent his honeymoon in 1880 on Mt. St. Helena within the park. The rocks that form the mountain are volcanic in origin, and erupted from a number of different volcanic centers between 2.6 and 8 million years ago. The vast Robert Louis Stevenson State Park spans three counties and offers distant views of Mt. Shasta, nearly 200 miles away. For an epic hike up Mt. St. Helena and to check out more stunning wine country summits, visit our Napa Valley<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/summit-hikes-napa-valley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> hiking guide</a>.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Retreat to the Wine Country Inn</h4>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-17d5a974-7fff-e243-e765-6e7a03777549\">All of these incredible state parks are in the upper valley, close to the charming town of St. Helena and the Wine Country Inn.
