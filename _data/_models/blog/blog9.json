  "long_description": "<p>On the eighteenth floor of our Times Square hotel, you'll find our newly renovated Executive Class Rooms. These were purposefully designed with a residential feel to create a sense of peace and tranquility in this home away from home. Details are important, which is why we've taken great care in selecting the art that hangs in these rooms and why our design team chose their sophisticated and soothing color palette. We selected plush pillow-top mattresses and a customized set of William Roam bath amenities, the kind of products you would buy for your own home. Each room includes a Tablet with a vast array of periodicals and a Nespresso machine with a wide selection of offerings. All of this was specifically decided on and meticulously carried out to ensure the most comfortable experience for our Executive Class guests. The ultimate comfort, steps away from Times Square.</p>"
