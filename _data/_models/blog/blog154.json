  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Shakespeare Napa Valley has been performing throughout wine country for almost a decade, but it wasn&rsquo;t until three years ago that the local theatre company began making international waves. Artistic Director Jennifer King launched Shakespeare Napa Valley onto the global stage after directing beloved Shakespeare classics in London and Prague. Now coming off a successful 2017 season featuring <em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em>, Shakespeare Napa Valley returns for a 2018 production of <em>As You Like It</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\"The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.\"</strong></h4>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>-William Shakespeare, <em>As You Like It</em></strong></h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This September through October, Jennifer King directs <em>As You Like It</em> by William Shakespeare. The comedic play follows exiled lovers Rosalind and Orlando as they become entangled with memorable characters and mistaken identity. <em>As You Like It </em>contains some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s most recognizable quotes and has become one of his more favored plays due to its many film adaptations through the years.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;All the world&rsquo;s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.&rdquo;</h4>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">-William Shakespeare, <em>As You Like It</em></h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">King&rsquo;s 90-minute interactive Shakespeare adaptation is set to perform at three different locations throughout the Napa Valley.
