The Metropolitan Museum of Art is opening it's doors early for guests to join \"The Museum Workout\", a high energy interactive journey through the institution. Participants will work up a sweat through constant movement, light exercises, and stretching. Commissioned by MetLiveArts and created by Monica Bills Barnes Dance company and writer/illusrator Maira Kalman, it's guaranteed to be an experience unlike any other. Lace up your dancing shoes and join the party. Audience members will listen to a combination of Motown and Disco hits mixed with Kalman's voice while dancing and gliding through the galleries. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to connect with art while activating your body, and what better time of day than in the morning. Performances are at 8:30 am Thursday to Sunday from January 19th - February 12.
