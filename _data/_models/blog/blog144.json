For gorgeous Napa Valley sights without trekking uphill, here are the best no-incline wine country hikes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Napa River Trail</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Take the 3.8-mile loop southbound away from downtown Napa along the Napa River. The Napa River Trail is accessible year-round and is a great place to view the calm waterway and waterfowl as you make your way through Kennedy Park before looping back north. Consider packing a picnic on this hike, as the 350-acre park has various picnic areas, fresh air, gorgeous scenery, and outdoor recreational games you&rsquo;ll want to take your time with.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kennedy+Park/@38.2686507,-122.2838197,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x8ee92e1b7f5b41fd?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjd0fG1isrcAhVjNn0KHWLpCGgQ_BIwDnoECAoQCw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> 2295 Streblow Dr, Napa</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/dog-friendly-hiking-trails-napa-valley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[5 Dog-Friendly Hiking Trails in Napa Valley]</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Trancas Crossing Park Loop</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Within Trancas Crossing Park north of downtown Napa is a moderate 0.7-mile loop perfect for a stroll along the Napa River western bank. Escape the bustling of downtown Napa for a pleasant walk on this paved surface. The station attendants are friendly and the views of the surrounding hills and wetlands are a perfect spot to observe native wildlife.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Trancas+Crossing+Park/@38.3280151,-122.2841742,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xc9b71b0189f40d56!8m2!3d38.3280151!4d-122.2841742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> 610 Trancas St, Napa</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Napa River Ecological Reserve Loop</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 1.3-mile loop trail will take you to the river, where if the water level is low enough, you can cross and stroll the quiet trail. Observe valley oak and wild plum trees and other native plants like snowberry, Himalaya berry, and wild rose. Hikers have seen many bird species, busy bees hard at work in a hive, and migrant juvenile steelheads making their way downstream in the spring.<em><a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/napa-river-ecological-reserve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Napa River Ecological Reserve, Yountville</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/blog/waterfall-hikes-napa-valley/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[3 Waterfall Hikes in Napa Valley]</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Petrified Forest Loop</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This 0.4-mile loop trail will take you through an ancient forest rich in geological history. The educational walk will lead past petrified trees, ancient ash flows, and a view of the volcano that created it all. Tucked up into the Mayacamas Mountains west of Calistoga, this dog-friendly trail is lined with beautiful wildflowers and only has a gain of 68 feet in elevation.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Petrified+Forest/@38.5557895,-122.6389618,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x6b38134b0eda0c5d!8m2!3d38.5557895!4d-122.6389618\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> 4100 Petrified Forest Rd, Calistoga</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ready for a hiking challenge?
