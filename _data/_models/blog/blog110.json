  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Every year from January to March, a blanket of yellow mustard flowers covers the vineyards of Napa Valley, luring visitors to pull over and snap a shot of the colorful blooms. Mustard flowers have become a vital part of the valley&rsquo;s agriculture, so much so that Napa Valley used to host a festival dedicated to the season. At a time when the vineyards lay bare and freshly pruned, mustard flower season only proves that anytime is a beautiful time to visit wine country.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These vibrant flowers are not indigenous to Napa Valley. It is believed that Franciscan missionaries brought the mustard seeds to the valley in the 1800s, perhaps using a trail of seeds to find their way back to encampment. Today, the flowers are proving especially useful to the success of the vineyards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the rainiest months, the flowers assist in irrigation as they minimize excessive water in the vineyards and protect the soil from heavy erosion. They also act as a natural pest repellent for microscopic worms looking to make a snack of the grapevines. As winter temperatures begin to subside, the mustard plant grows and releases biofumigants (or natural substances), which suppresses these soil-borne pests. With irrigation, erosion, and pests out of the way, the grapevines thrive.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The mustard flower will soon be plowed under to create a rich compost full of nutrients and phosphorus integral to the success of the vineyards. Until then, the golden glow is a sight to see during your visit to Napa Valley.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is no perfect spot to view this picturesque bloom. Drive along any of the crossroads of the Napa Valley that connect Highway 29 to the Silverado Trail to see the flowers up close. Or ascend into the Vaca Mountains on the east or the Mayacamus Mountains on the west for a bird&rsquo;s-eye view.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Planning a trip to Napa Valley to catch Mustard Season?
