  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Diving into Napa Valley&rsquo;s surrounding wooded spots is a great way to experience wine country. Replete with amazing hikes and trails, the valley is a haven for hidden waterfalls, from 100-foot cascading waterfalls to the tranquil trickle of bubbling falls. With a little effort, you can discover these scenic natural wonders around the valley. Here are three waterfall hikes in Napa Valley to get you started.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Archer Taylor Preserve</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This 7-mile trail loop brings you around just a fraction of the 380 acres of the Archer Taylor Preserve. The preserve contains one of the largest redwood stands in Napa County as well as 240 species of native plants like wild strawberries and huckleberries. Abundant wildlife roams the protected preserve, so keep watch for deer, fox, mountain lion, large pileated woodpeckers, and the occasional bear. The trail will bring you to several cliffs, creeks, and waterfalls. Visitors have had the luck of seeing the beautiful Devil&rsquo;s Well Waterfalls raging after a particularly heavy rainfall. The 4-hour round trip hike is only doable as a guided tour, with reservations to be made in advance. Unfortunately the preserve is undergoing wildfire damage restoration and is scheduled to reopen summer 2018. Visit the<a href=\"https://www.napalandtrust.org/permanent-preserve-network/archer-taylor/\"> Land Trust of Napa County</a> for trail information, updates, and to sign up for hikes.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/archer+taylor+preserve/@38.3520413,-122.4948942,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x808506050bb4ea89:0xe563ba70af593e3c!2m2!1d-122.4248542!2d38.3520621\"> Archer Taylor Preserve, Napa</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Linda Falls</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Located near the town of Angwin, Linda Falls cascades nearly 70 feet over volcanic boulders. Linda Falls is part of the Conn Creek, a sprawling watershed that is protected by the Land Trust of Napa Valley. The creek lies within a lush coniferous forest, blanketed by a canopy of Douglas fir, Madrone, Canyon live oak, Black oak, and California Bay trees. The small hike to Linda Falls is best done during Napa&rsquo;s rainy season, when several smaller waterfalls appear. Access to the falls is by permission only and through guided hikes. Visit the<a href=\"https://www.napalandtrust.org/permanent-preserve-network/linda-falls/\"> Land Trust of Napa Valley</a> for more information.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Linda+Falls/@38.556033,-122.4462842,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x80845a2a5c4618d5:0x2eb6afe66f10b273!2sLinda+Falls+Terrace,+Angwin,+CA+94508!3b1!8m2!3d38.5561337!4d-122.447636!3m4!1s0x80845986b9e70083:0x12e1b9d2f8d39ecf!8m2!3d38.5557409!4d-122.4422018\"> Linda Falls Terrace, Angwin</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Zim Zim Falls</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Zim Zim Falls Trail is for the more experienced hiker, but the 100-foot waterfall will be worth the trek. At about 8 miles long, there are several obstacles to keep in mind while hiking the trail. Crossing the Zim Zim Creek multiple times is required, so keep that in mind when choosing footwear. Occasional ticks, limited shade, and a steep and slippery incline right before the waterfall can be a hassle, but the blooms of the wildflowers and the views of the gorgeous waterfall are a must-see in Napa Valley.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zim+Zim+Falls+Trail,+Napa,+CA+94558/@38.7657699,-122.3046202,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80848b726cbaca19:0x7587fdc88a853361!8m2!3d38.7657699!4d-122.3024315\"> Zim Zim Falls Trail, Napa</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2a3fc71f-1dda-5924-11f0-7b8d3b3172d2\">Are you planning a trip to Napa Valley to enjoy the scenic beauty?
