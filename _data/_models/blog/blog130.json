  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">With summer officially here, now is the time to plan your next outdoor adventure. Napa Valley has plenty of beautiful hike-worthy hills, but for a bit of a challenge, why not take on an entire mountain? Long distance, mighty elevation, airy exposure &ndash; summit hikes are only for the venturesome. Gain some serious altitude with these summit day hikes in Napa Valley.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Mount Saint Helena</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Located near the town of Calistoga in Napa Valley, Mount St. Helena is the highest peak in California wine country. Sweeping views of the surrounding counties and vineyards come with a price, and the cost is a difficult 9.3-mile out and back trail with over 2,000 feet of elevation gain. Starting on Stevenson Memorial Trail in<a href=\"http://napavalleystateparks.org/robert-louis-stevenson-state-park/\"> Robert Louis Stevenson State Park</a>, take the path to the Mt. St. Helena Trail to begin your ascension. Along the old logging road, you may notice the charred aftermath of the catastrophic Tubbs fire, as new vegetation continues to bloom. Most of the trail provides very little shade, so pack sunscreen and a lightweight sun hat.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Coyote Peak</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nestled in the Mayacamas Mountains along Napa Valley&rsquo;s western corridor lies the 1,991-acre<a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bothe-Napa+Valley+State+Park/@38.540107,-122.5376006,15z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x45aa191420dc96a0!5m1!1s2018-07-02!8m2!3d38.540107!4d-122.5376006\"> Bothe-Napa Valley State Park</a>, where you&rsquo;ll find the farthest inland coast redwoods in any California state park. Park just beyond the visitor center, where you&rsquo;ll encounter a friendly staff and a helpful map that will take you up redwood-lined trails towards Coyote Peak. After paying the small visitors fee, begin at the Woodland Trail and follow Ritchey creek until the trail crosses the stream. Take Ritchey Canyon Trail to the right and begin a slight incline through a forest of tall Redwood, Douglas Fir, Tanoak, and Madrone trees, moss-covered branches, and a trickling creek. Bear to the left on Spring Trail where the path gets much steeper and begin your gradual climb towards Coyote Peak Trail. The wooded areas will soon give way to beautiful manzanitas and an open sky. Once you summit, you&rsquo;ll catch views of upper Napa Valley's rolling hills and vineyards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The trail will eventually lead back downhill and to the parking area. This 3-mile trek has plenty of photo ops, shade, and incredible views, which make for a quiet retreat away from the bustle of the valley.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Duff Peak</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those ready to try a summit hike but would like some guidance along the way, the Land Trust of Napa Valley offers year-round escorted hikes to some of the valley&rsquo;s most breathtaking locations. One of the most intense hikes on their schedule is the<a href=\"https://www.napalandtrust.org/hikes/wildlake-to-duff-peak/\"> Wildlake to Duff Peak</a> hike near the town of Angwin. This strenuous 12-mile hike has 1-2k feet of elevation gain and ascends into the eastern hills of the valley. Follow the ridge that separates Pope and Napa Valleys while overlooking the Oat Hill Mine Trail and the distant Palisades in the Robert Louis Stevenson State Park. Once you reach the small volcanic dome that is Duff Peak, you will see its unique rocky crags and magnificent views of the surrounding range.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a65799d7-4284-4621-47b0-12dc2986ad8b\">After a day of heavy incline hiking, stay with the<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/\"> Wine Country Inn</a> for a relaxing retreat in the heart of Napa Valley and a short drive from the trailheads.
