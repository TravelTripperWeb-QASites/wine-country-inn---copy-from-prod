  "long_description": "<p>New York City is considered by blues fans to be a kind of mecca. If you've come in search of the quintessential blues club, we've got just the place to recommend. Terra Blues, located less than 15 minutes from our Times Square hotel, is as authentic a blues venue as they come. Step inside and be immediately enveloped by the intimacy of the space. The candlelit tables and thick velvet curtains that frame the members of a soulful band, create a characteristically moody ambiance. The club is frequented by some of the great names of the genre such as Michael Powers and Clarence Spady, and has an immensely talented house band that makes every night a memorable experience. The night begins at 7 p.m. with an acoustic set, followed by featured artists at 10 p.m. Stop by, order a drink from their extensive whiskey and bourbon menu, and enjoy the smooth melodies of the blues.</p> <br> <p>149 Bleecker Street, New York, NY 10012</p>"
