  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Napa Valley is home to two Culinary Institute of America campuses, both leading the way in culinary, baking, and pastry arts education. Their beautiful Greystone campus in St. Helena features two dining establishments which spotlight cuisine and confections created by CIA students. And the CIA&rsquo;s branch campus at Copia in downtown Napa features a chic New American eatery. One day these student-chefs may be leading the food scene in Napa or New York City at their own Michelin-starred restaurant. But for now, you can revel in their culinary creations at one of these Napa Valley eateries.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Gatehouse Restaurant</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Gatehouse Restaurant at the Greystone campus serves up cuisine made with regional ingredients and produce from their own farm and herb gardens. Contemporary dishes are created by faculty-led CIA students who have completed years of culinary, baking and pastry, hospitality and beverage management training. Enjoy a three or four course prix-fixe menu featuring menu items like the Muscovy duck breast pastrami, Pacific Dungeness crab risotto, and Meyer lemon pudding cake. For reservations and current offerings, visit the<a href=\"http://www.ciarestaurantgroup.com/gatehouse-restaurant/\"> Gatehouse Restaurant</a>.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The Bakery Caf&eacute; at illy</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also at the Greystone campus is The Bakery Caf&eacute;, a small brasserie featuring light caf&eacute; fare like classic pastries, freshly baked bread, handmade chocolates, and specialty salads, sandwiches, and sides created by CIA baking and pastry arts students and faculty. They also have an espresso and tea bar, house-made beverages, wines by the glass, and local microbrews. We recommend the Prosciutto di Parma sandwich with Fromage d'Affinois cheese and Dijon mustard on a sweet baguette with a side salad or cup of soup. The best part? The Caf&eacute; is happy to pack your order up for you to enjoy at a nearby winery.

Dine in the restaurant, grab a wine, beer, or handcrafted cocktail with friends at the bar, or relax in the lounge while enjoying a unique dining experience in this food and wine lover&rsquo;s paradise. Their menu changes frequently, but you can expect entrees like Fisherman&rsquo;s stew and Venetian fettuccini, and brunch items like steak tartare and chicken and waffles.
