This modern steakhouse sources their dry-aged, USDA prime beef and other meats from local purveyors and under the direct supervision of Butcher Bryan Flannery. One of the best in the business, Chef Flannery&rsquo;s meats are of the highest quality available. Local produce is from Rudd Farms, which sits atop Mt. Veeder in the Mayacamas Mountains just minutes away from PRESS.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The freshness of the Napa Valley bounty can be tasted in their fine cuisine. Begin your experience with complimentary bread options like the crispy rosemary breadsticks and savory cheese rolls. Indulge in any of Chef Flannery&rsquo;s prime cut meats cooked to perfection, like the ribeye or Filet Mignon.<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/PRESS/@38.4888976,-122.4506616,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x364af083c199c6f0!8m2!3d38.4888976!4d-122.4506616\"> 587 St. Helena Highway</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Harvest Table</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Harvest Table, fare is as fresh as it gets.
