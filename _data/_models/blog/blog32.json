  "long_description": "<p>December is officially in full swing, time to visit Bryant Park Winter Village. Nothing says the holidays like a market full of possibilities, iceskating, and hot cocoa. Get cozy on a couch or in a lounger at rink-side popup restaurant Public Fare. Warm your tummies with our favorite grilled cheese and tomato soup. Afterwards, lace up your skates and take a few laps around the 17,000 square-foot outdoor iceskating rink. Don't have skates? Not a problem, rent a pair for $20. Not the skating type? Take your time and explore over 125 holiday kiosks and eateries featuring everything from artisanal chocolates, to handcrafted Christmas ornaments, to vegan soup options. There is truly something for everyone! On the coldest of days, you can snuggle up near an outdoor fire pit at the Southwest Porch while enjoying a cocktail or beer. Bryant Park is the home to cultural events such as New York's Fashion Week, Summer Movies Series, and free yoga - but it's finest contribution to tourists and residents alike, is this magical Winter Wonderland!</p> <p><i>Bryant Park is situated behind the New York Public Library in Midtown Manhattan, between 40th and 42nd Streets & Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Take the B, D, F, or M train to 42nd Street/Bryant Park or take the & train to Fifth Avenue to join in the fun. </i></p> "
