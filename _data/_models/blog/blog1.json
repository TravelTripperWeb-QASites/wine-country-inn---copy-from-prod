  "long_description": "<p>Are you a fan of craft beer? Then get your glass ready for the 7th Annual NYC Beer Week, running from February 19th to the 28th. The event highlights forty different breweries from all over New York, including local institutions like Brooklyn Brewery, Big Alice Brewing and more. With over two hundred events taking place all over the city, there's no shortage of things to see and do â€“ and drink! There will be food and beer pairing tastings, home-brewing workshops, a Beer 101 panel, even a beer trivia night! For all connoisseurs of good local beer, this is the event that you've been waiting for! And when you're done, our Times Square hotel is just a cab ride away (always drink safely and responsibly!).</p> <br> <p><a href=\"http://newyorkcitybrewersguild.com/beer-week/2016-beer-week/\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></p> <p>Address: Throughout New York City</p> "
