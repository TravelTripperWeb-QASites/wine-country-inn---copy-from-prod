  "long_description": "<p>One of the best parts of a summer in New York City is the atmosphere of spontaneity mixed with the thriving culture of music. You might have to wait in line a while, and if you don't mind paying for a spot, the most accessible concerts are located in Central Park Ramsey Playfield, just a ten minute cab ride from the Manhattan at Times Square Hotel. </p> <p> New York City's renowned jazz culture has a rich and deep history, which is what makes catching a jazz concert in Central Park so special. Back in the 1940's, NYC was the top venue for the musical movement and the celebrities of the jazz world. Famous musicians flocked to the city to evolve their craft. Even New York's brilliant histories with blues, soul, and disco stemmed from its familiarity with jazz. Coming up are some big names in the contemporary jazz world, and the city has provided a great opportunity to see McCoy Tyner Quartet, bassist Ron Carter, and drummer Roy Haynes. Hear past and present collide with other jazz enthusiasts in the best park NYC has to offer. Or, if you prefer your music mixed with comedy, hold out for the show starring New Zealand based musical-comedy duo, Flight of the Conchords. </p> <p> Plan your trip right, and you might even be able to catch one of the BRIC's free \"Celebrate Brooklyn!\" concerts in Prospect Park, just a short drive from our Times Square hotel. With some great names like Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, Violent Femmes, Kristen Hirsch, and trailblazing dance company PHILADANCO, Brooklyn provides even more opportunities to get musically and artistically cultured. </p> <p> After your night out, grab dinner at one of Brooklyn or Manhattan's many hole-in-the-wall restaurants to keep up that cultured atmosphere before heading back to your hotel room for a good night's sleep. </p> <p> Address: 14 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021</p>"
