  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Planning a wine tour isn&rsquo;t easy. Where to go, how to get there, where to park - all planning nuisances that can distract you from the pleasures of a Napa Valley wine experience. Now, there&rsquo;s a new way to get around Napa Valley, and it&rsquo;s been flying under the radar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uber &ndash; the leading pioneer of peer-to-peer ridesharing - launched UberWINE back in 2015. This special feature pairs you with one driver for the entire day, to chauffeur you to wineries of your choice, on your own time. Unlike the strict schedule of a wine tour or party bus, UberWINE allows you to spend as much time as you want at any location within the valley. A more convenient and stress-free wine country experience awaits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It&rsquo;s simple. Download the<a href=\"https://auth.uber.com/login/?uber_client_name=riderSignUp&amp;utm_source=AdWords_Brand&amp;utm_campaign=search-google-brand_1_99_us-national_r_txt_acq_cpc_en-us_%2Buber%20%2Bapp_kwd-297923000858_226289812543_50137049187_b_c_&amp;cid=927396196&amp;adg_id=50137049187&amp;fi_id=&amp;match=b&amp;net=g&amp;dev=c&amp;dev_m=&amp;cre=226289812543&amp;kwid=kwd-297923000858&amp;kw=%2Buber%20%2Bapp&amp;placement=&amp;tar=&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwmPPYBRCgARIsALOziAOWPUP9kC2Dosat4Kyo8unCnRi8DoJHnFtPxUrimn3bbjjz5-I_WMIaAtVsEALw_wcB\"> Uber app</a> and go to the specialty section. Swipe left of the UberX, until you have the option to select &lsquo;WINE&rsquo; (pairing you with a vehicle that can seat up to four) or &lsquo;WINEXL&rsquo; (which seats 6). Once you&rsquo;ve selected, you will then be paired with a driver for the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can leave any belongings you want in the car while you visit your destinations (like bottles purchased). When you&rsquo;re ready to be whisked away to the next destination, you can text your driver and simply add your next location into the app. Your total fare will be updated every time you add a new stop. You can even get an estimate for the entire day before riding for a ballpark price. Although there is no limit for how long you spend at each winery, the UberWINE service is only available between 9am and 6pm, every day of the week.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The average cost of an UberWINE vehicle is roughly $35/hr, which is way cheaper than a private car service, wine bus, or limo. The more people you ride with, the more ways to split the cost. For now, the UberWINE service is only available in two national wine regions - Santa Barbara and Napa/Sonoma Valley, and Guadeloupe, Mexico.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-d36ea6fc-ff24-8ad5-7218-81b40814407c\">Are you ready for a relaxed UberWINE winery tour of Napa Valley?
