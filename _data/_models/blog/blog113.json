Napa and Sonoma Valleys may be neighbors, but each destination offers a wine country getaway with a unique experience. Napa and Sonoma are America&rsquo;s two main wine attractions, so why choose just one? Visit both.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Visiting Napa</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rising to the top of wine-tourism after the 1976<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/05/24/479163882/the-judgment-of-paris-the-blind-taste-test-that-decanted-the-wine-world\"> Judgment of Paris</a>, Napa Valley remains America's premiere destination for wine tourism, history, education, and enjoyment. Referred to as the &lsquo;Vegas of wine country&rsquo;, people come from all over the world to explore Napa Valley&rsquo;s 400+ wineries. The walkability of the wine region is unparalleled, and the towns of Napa and St. Helena allow you to winery jump quite easily.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Varietals of Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Merlot shine across the valley. Don&rsquo;t miss the 13th-century-style Castello di Amorosa winery in Calistoga, the sprawling V. Sattui Winery in St. Helena, or Robert Mondavi in Oakville, considered by many as the winery that put Napa Valley on the map.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Besides the award-winning elite wineries, the valley is home to several trendy Michelin-starred restaurants, which offer multi-course meals. Golf courses, spas, and hiking areas that litter the valley and the surrounding foothills give you scenic views and peaceful escapism.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Visiting Sonoma</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wine blogger Tom Wark wrote, &ldquo;Napa Valley is a Wine Disneyland, while Sonoma Valley is a Wine Region.&rdquo; At almost three times the size of Napa, Sonoma County stretches across nine cities. You may be able to traverse Napa wineries quickly, but in order to take full advantage of all that the Sonoma wine region has to offer, you will be spending a lot of time in a car between tastings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Considered the birthplace of the California wine industry, Sonoma County is home to some of the oldest vineyards and wineries in the state. Often praised for its casualness and affordability, Sonoma wineries specialize in Pinot Noir, Zinfandel, Red Blends, Sparkling Wine, and unoaked Chardonnay. The wider variety of grapes grown in the region will lead you to varietals not often found in Napa. Notable wineries include the beautiful Iron Horse Vineyards in Sebastopal, the historic Kunde Family Winery in Kenwood, and the award-winning Cline Cellars in Sonoma.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The town of Sonoma lies within the 17-mile-long valley, and is an excellent place to wander around the historic adobe buildings, boutiques, and restaurants. For a change of scenery, check out the sleepy fishing town of Bodega Bay, and the picturesque Bohemian Hwy that will take you to the charming town of Occidental where you can peruse art galleries or zipline through the Redwood canopy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f3826305-7cac-5b6b-6441-20bd3517fd17\">Want to experience America&rsquo;s two main wine attractions yourself?
