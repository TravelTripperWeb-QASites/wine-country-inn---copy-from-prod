  "long_description": "<p>Nothing quite says fall like intentionally getting yourself lost in a bunch of corn. Thankfully, this is still possible even near a big city like New York. Queens County Farm Museum is famous for the fall events it puts on every year, from pumpkin patches to festivals to the Amazing Maize Maze. </p><p> All month long, the museum is open for visitors, even on Columbus Day. Weather permitting, visitors are welcome to traverse through this three-acre maze. And if you thought you'd just be walking around, think again. You'll have to find clues and solve puzzles to get out of this sucker. </p><p> If that's not scary enough for you, you can brave the maze by moonlight two nights this month, on October 15th and 22nd. These two Saturdays, the maze stays open until 9:00 at night, and you can relive every horror movie you've ever seen with a setting in the Midwest.</p> "
