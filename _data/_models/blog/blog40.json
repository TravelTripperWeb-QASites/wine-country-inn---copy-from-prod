St. Patrick's Day began in Ireland as a cultural and religious festival that occurred annually on March 17. It was held in honor of the death of Ireland's most worshipped patron Saint. It's now a widespread holiday and people from every ethnicity and every part of the world becomes a little Irish for the day. Grab a spot along the parade route which travels along Fifth Avenue from East 44th Street to 70th Street and passes by the recently renovated St. Patrick's Cathedral. It's a feast for the eyes!</p><p>St. Patricks Day Parade, March 17th, 11:00 am to 5:00pm</p>"
