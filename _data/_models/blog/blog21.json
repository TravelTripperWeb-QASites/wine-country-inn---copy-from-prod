So if you have time during your visit to chill out for a bit and escape the heat, find some rest and relaxation at one of the many spas New York City has to offer. </p><p>Whether you're looking for just a massage or a full day of mud baths and facials, there is a spa for everything in the Big Apple. For those seeking a more quick, low maintenance spa experience, should consider the Artisan Spa near Union Square, where entertainment and tea is provided and the prices are competitive. Get a shoulder massage during your mani and pedi, and recline while watching your favorite television show. </p><p>For those looking for a high-end spa to wow your socks off, Aire Ancient Baths is one of the top-rated spas in the city. With locations in Paris, Seville, and Barcelona, the New York Aire Ancient Bath has pools and locker rooms used for the 2014 Keanu Reeves film John Wick. This should tell you that the atmosphere in the Aire Ancient Baths is unrivaledâ€”cool, relaxing, and stunning enough for a Hollywood film. </p><p>Even the pools here are quiet, as Aire Ancient Baths primarily works off reservations (so be sure to book, if this is the right place for you), so it isn't difficult to find a place to yourself. Choose from massage, thermal baths, aromatherapy treatments, and exfoliants when you make your appointment. Though their prices are less competitive, many who go rave about the unique baths and the incredible customer service. </p><p>When you've recharged, head out for a night on the town or back to your room at the Manhattan for the best sleep of your life.</p><p>Address: 7th Ave 59th Street, Central Park South, New York City, NY 10019</p>"
