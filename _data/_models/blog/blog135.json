  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">There is something about the sunny days and warm weather that makes us reach for a crisp glass of refreshing ros&eacute; to satisfy our summer taste buds. The growing popularity of ros&eacute; wine is a welcomed trend, although it leaves us wondering, how much do we really know about this pink drink? Here&rsquo;s a guide to this buzzworthy varietal, as well as where to sip the most popular wine country ros&eacute;s of the season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No, ros&eacute; isn&rsquo;t made from a rare pink grape or even a combination of red and white grapes. The rosy color comes from the short amount of time the grape juice comes into contact with the skins of the grapes. In fact, this is how all wines obtain their color. Red grapes are juiced and then allowed to soak with the skins for a short period of time, until the vibrant blush color comes forward.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Besides the soft color, ros&eacute; wines stand out for their crisp freshness, bright aromas, and fruit-forward profile. Just like the spectrum of red and white wines, ros&eacute; has a wide variety of aromas and flavors. Notes of strawberry, watermelon, cherry, and citrus are most common.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ready for some ros&eacute;? Here are three local ros&eacute; wines to check out this summer on your wine country vacation.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">2017 Ode to Lulu Ros&eacute;,<a href=\"https://www.bedrockwineco.com/\"> Bedrock Wine Company</a>, Sonoma</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This drinkable ros&eacute; made the <em>Food and Wine</em><a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/wine/best-rose-summer-2018\"> list</a> of 30 ros&eacute;s to drink this summer. Made from old vine Mourvedre and Grenache grapes, this ros&eacute; has delicate notes of raspberries, peaches, and apple blossoms. Don&rsquo;t let the light color of this wine fool you, the savory Mourvedre and spicy notes of Grenache give this ros&eacute; unexpected depth. To try this bold and refreshing wine, visit Bedrock&rsquo;s new tasting room at the historic Joseph Hooker House in downtown Sonoma.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">2017 Sylviane Ros&eacute;,<a href=\"https://www.ehlersestate.com/\"> Ehlers Estate</a>, St. Helena</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Featured on <em>Vine Pair&rsquo;s</em><a href=\"https://vinepair.com/articles/25-best-rose-wines-2018/\"> 25 Best Ros&eacute; Wines of 2018</a>, this old-world ros&eacute; has aromas of watermelon, raspberry, and cotton candy with orange sorbet and fresh red cherries.
