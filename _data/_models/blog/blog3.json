  "long_description": "<p>January 1st has come and gone, but if you still haven't gotten your New Year fix, then check out the Better Chinatown Society's celebration of the Chinese New Year on February 8th at Sara D. Roosevelt Park. Located less than twenty minutes from our Times Square hotel, celebrate the Year of the Monkey with a massive five-hundred thousand firecracker display (yes, you read that number right), as well as lion dances with colorful masks and costumes, craft vendors and food booths filled with dumplings and other tasty traditional goodies. If that's not enough, there's also the Annual Lunar New Year Parade and Festival on the 14th in Chinatown, which will feature martial arts showcases, cultural performances, calligraphy and awesome giveaways! How's that for a happy new year?</p><br><p>Address: Sara D. Roosevelt Park, New York City</p>"
