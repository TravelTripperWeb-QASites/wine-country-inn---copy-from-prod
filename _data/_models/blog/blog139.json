The beautifully restored art deco building dates back to 1937, and has hosted past comedic acts like Kathy Griffin and Ron White. The upcoming<a href=\"http://www.uptowntheatrenapa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> summer lineup</a> is packed with comedy kings and queens, like Grammy-award nominee Tig Notaro, known for her dark comedy and deadpan humor.

In addition to various performing arts, Lucky Penny produces special presentations by comedians, from stand-up to comedic theatre. Still to come this summer is Comedy Night with Johnny Steele, an award-winning comedian and host of KRON/Bay TV&rsquo;s <em>THE SHOW</em>.
