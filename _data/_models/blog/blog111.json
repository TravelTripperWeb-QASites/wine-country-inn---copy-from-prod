  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Napa Valley offers miles of scenic trails you can explore with your dog during your visit. Enjoy the natural beauty of the valley by spending the day trekking through the grassy hillsides, rocky terrain, and forested foothills of wine country. If you&rsquo;re looking for a respite from wine tasting, here are a few suggested trails to traverse around the valley with your four-legged friend.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Lake Hennessey Shoreline Trail</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With colorful grasses and beautiful lake views, the 5.6-mile Lake Hennessey Shoreline Trail loop traces the perimeter of the fresh-lake reservoir. The wide-trail is suitable for beginners, with plenty of shade and beautiful vistas. The terrain does change throughout and a portion of the trail has a steady incline. We recommend you get there first thing in the morning for the best chance to spot local wildlife. Dogs are welcomed, but must be leashed.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Napa+County+Regional+Park+District+-+Lake+Hennessey+City+Recreation+Area/@38.4871798,-122.3504929,11.37z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x763a9cfc2e91be26!8m2!3d38.4963694!4d-122.3617618?hl=en-US\">2602 Chiles Pope Valley Rd, St. Helena</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Oat Hill Mine Trail</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A more moderate hike on this list is the incredible Oat Hill Mine Trail, which follows 8.3 miles of an old stagecoach route over an elevation change of 1500 feet. If you look closely, you may even spot grooves in the rocks from wagon wheels. As you ascend the steady incline through forest and rocky terrain, you may come across small waterfalls following particularly heavy rains. And if you can make it all the way to the cliffs you will have spectacular views of Anderson and Napa Valleys. Dogs are allowed off-leash if under voice control, but beware of poison oak.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oat+Hill+Mine+Trailhead/@38.5892468,-122.5793604,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x808443061d96ecab:0xd55518e5ba24cf96!2s1800+Lincoln+Ave,+Calistoga,+CA+94515!3b1!8m2!3d38.5849113!4d-122.5778093!3m4!1s0x80844306a9292647:0xca1c64b5ae90228f!8m2!3d38.5892427!4d-122.5771719\">2082 Oat Hill Mine Trail, Calistoga</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">History Trail</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This moderate 2.4-mile loop will give you a small glimpse into Napa Valley&rsquo;s rural heritage. Along the way, check out Pioneer Cemetery, which contains the remains of several early Napa Valley pioneers; the site of White Church, the first church in Napa Valley; and the beautiful Bale Grist Mill, a water-powered gristmill from 1846. The natural beauty along the trail is also quite charming. The trail is exceptional for plant enthusiasts and bird watchers, as it passes through dense forest and along Mill Creek. Dogs are allowed on leash only.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir//38.540429,-122.510186/@38.5406429,-122.5110266,17z\">3331 St. Helena Hwy, St. Helena</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Table Rock</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Table Rock trail isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart and is recommended for hikers and dogs prepared to scale some terrain! This 5-mile round-trip has quick landscape changes, with some moderate rock climbing and steep inclines required to reach the summit. A highlight of the trail is a flat hillside with an elaborate labyrinth of rock art. The most breathtaking views come from Table Rock, a rocky jagged cliffside with giant boulders and a stunning overlook of the vineyards throughout the valley.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Robert+Louis+Stevenson+State+Park/@38.6545203,-122.5971808,14z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x808469a4d0f8135f:0x249c49e54298a6a5!2sRobert+Louis+Stevenson+State+Park!8m2!3d38.6616875!4d-122.6217555!3m4!1s0x808469a4d0f8135f:0x249c49e54298a6a5!8m2!3d38.6616875!4d-122.6217555\">3801 Saint Helena Hwy, Calistoga</a></em></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Las Posadas State Forest Loop</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This 4.1-mile loop trail is mostly flat, with a few gently sloping hills. The ups and downs and turns make getting lost fairly easy, so make sure to get your bearings. This walk through the woods may put you in close contact with local wildlife (and equestrians!) so keep your dog close. Take in the ferns, evergreens, and other flora as you circle a picturesque meadow. This shady trail is perfect for beginners and dogs alike.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/Las+Posadas+State+Forest+Loop/@38.5563056,-122.4742914,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x80845822fa857233:0x9b0be802b61711fc!2m2!1d-122.4042514!2d38.5563265\">Las Posadas State Forest, Angwin</a></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember, always follow the posted rules as they may have changed. Respect and protect wildlife habitats, and help keep these trails dog-friendly by picking up after your dog.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you planning a trip to Napa Valley with your four-legged friend?
