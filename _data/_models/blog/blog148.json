Paint and Sip parties have been growing in popularity and are the perfect opportunity to channel your inner artist while enjoying a glass of wine. Here is all you need to know about the Paint and Sip, and where to find one on your<a href=\"https://www.winecountryinn.com/offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Napa Valley getaway</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">What is a Paint and Sip party?</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sip on some of the finest wine from the Napa Valley while creating a visual masterpiece under the direction of an art instructor. In your professionally-led class, you will have the opportunity to paint a (usually pre-determined) canvas with a group of like-minded wine drinkers. No need to bring art supplies, the venue will provide canvas, paints, brushes, and protective smocks for your session. Don&rsquo;t worry about your art skills either, your instructor will walk you through the painting process, from mixing colors, to what brush strokes to use to create your work of art.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don&rsquo;t forget the wine! Check the location&rsquo;s food and beverage policy to find out if you should bring a bottle. Most of the Napa Valley&rsquo;s Paint and Sip parties are hosted by a local winery, so all you need to bring is yourself. Keep your finished work of art for a perfect memento from your wine country vacation.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Where to find a Paint and Sip party in the Napa Valley</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the largest wine region in the United States, finding a Paint and Sip party is simple.
