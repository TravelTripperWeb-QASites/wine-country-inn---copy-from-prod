  "long_description": "<p>Macy's annual two-week floral exhibition returns this year with a patriotic theme of \"America the Beautiful.\" Expect the ground floor of the department store's Herald Square location to be transformed into a veritable botanical garden with a stunning variety of native plants. Starting March 20, the various bouquets and arrangements will pay a beautiful homage to our country. Visitors will see representations of the deserts of Southwest, the prairies of the Great Plains, the forests of the Northwest and the many other regions found between our Pacific and Atlantic coasts. As guests walk through the store, just ten minutes from our Times Square hotel, they'll have the chance to create their own arrangements and take home a little bit of beauty. If the concrete jungle's got you feeling a little tense, head to Macy's for a high dose of nature. </p> <br> <p>Address: 151 W 34th St, New York, NY </p>"
