  "long_description": "<p>Brunch has become a New York must-do, almost up there with visiting the Empire State Building, but if the idea of plain old brunch isn't that appealing, you can one-up it with Hornblower's Jazzy Champagne Brunch Cruise. Why settle for brunch in a crowded Lower East Side restaurant when you can take your French toast on a luxury yacht cruising along the Manhattan coastline? Arrive at Pier 40, just twenty minutes from our Times Square hotel, to board your brunch cruise. Once you're settled on the yacht, enjoy a complete breakfast buffet with all the classics, as well as some chef-selected specialties and all-you-can-drink mimosas while you're treated to the live music of a world-class jazz band and an onboard DJ. While you sip and eat, the captain will take you around to the most iconic sights, like the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Brooklyn Bridge and more. On this cruise, the photo-ops flow as freely as the champagne.</p> <br> <p>Address: 353 West Street, New York, NYA</p>"
