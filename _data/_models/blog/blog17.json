  "short_description": "<p>It wouldn't be a proper New York summer without Shakespeare in the Park. You can catch this year's performance at the open-air Delacorte Theater in Central Park, a fifteen minute drive from the Manhattan at Times Square Hotel. </p> <p>For a short time, you can still catch a fascinating twist on Shakespeare's well-known comedy The Taming of the Shrew until it wraps up on June 26th. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd, this version of the timeless comedy will surely make you laugh, think, and enjoy a priceless opportunity to see Shakespeare performed by an all-female cast. </p><p>After that play wraps up, Troilus and Cressida, directed by Daniel Sullivan, will take its place from July 19th to August 14th. Lesser known among the public, this Shakespeare tragedy about the Trojan War is one of his most mysterious. Having vexed critics and general audiences alike, this play is sure to be an unforgettably intellectual experience. </p><p>Performances are most frequently held from Tuesday to Sunday nights in the summer, and the shows start at eight in the evening. The greatest thing about Shakespeare in the Park is that it's free to the publicâ€”but that can also mean having to be crafty about when you go, if you want to make sure to get a seat. Some suggestions for doing just that include committing on days when the weather is a little less nice, as Shakespeare in the Park is hardly ever rained off the stage. If you time your trip right, it's also best to go during the first week of performances, before the hype.</p><p>There are several ways to get tickets, but the easiest is to line up outside the theatre the day you want to see the show. It's best to do this before ten in the morning, but the earlier the better. Prepare for long lines and a long wait in order to get those tickets. However, if you have other things to see in the Big Apple that day, you can also enter an online lottery, though there's no guarantee of getting a ticket. </p><p>Address: Delacorte Theater Box Office, 81 Central Park West, New York, NY 10023</p> "
