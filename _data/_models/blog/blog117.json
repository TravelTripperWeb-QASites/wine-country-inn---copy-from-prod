  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Napa Valley is known for its sprawling vineyards, lush landscape, gorgeous wine estates, and rolling foothills. Whether you are traversing the valley by car on one of its winding roads, or hiking the mountains for spectacular vineyard views, there is no wrong way to see the beauty of Napa Valley. But for something different, why not get a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of one of the most beautiful valleys in the world? The Wine Country Inn and Cottages in the heart of Napa Valley is offering the <em>Up, Up and Away</em> package that will give you and your loved one sweeping views of Napa Valley, all from within a hot air balloon.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fly over the Napa Valley with a certified FAA pilot and professional staff to guide you on your adventure. The <em>Up, Up and Away</em> package includes hotel pick up and drop off as you begin at a pre-dawn check-in with hot coffee and an assortment of teas, pastries, whole fruit, and juice. After a brief orientation, you head to the launch site for lift off. Take in the panoramic views, redwood tree tops, and infinite grids of vineyards on the nearly hour-long morning flight over the valley. Commemorate your experience with a complimentary in-flight photo.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enjoy a post-flight champagne brunch at Domaine Chandon Winery in Yountville. Sample their famous sparkling and still wines on their stunning terrace surrounded by majestic oak trees and beautiful greenery. Make sure to try their &eacute;toile Ros&eacute;, a visitor favorite with fresh aromas of plum, raspberry, and nutmeg, layered with delicate flavors of cocoa powder.</p>\n<p>Your Napa Valley visit doesn&rsquo;t end there. The Wine Country Inn and Cottages is a destination in and of itself. The <em>Up, Up and Away</em> package also gives you access to complimentary wine and cheese tastings every Friday and Sunday in the charming Winery House, hosted by a local vintner. Indulge in daily wine country breakfasts at this romantic boutique hotel. Or simply enjoy the views of the hundreds of acres of vineyards right from your own room.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure to dress appropriately for your balloon excursion. Early mornings in Napa Valley can be quite chilly, and it can be even colder at higher altitudes so a jacket is recommended. A hat and sunglasses may be useful to protect against the sun and the heat from the burner. Getting in and out of the balloon basket may involve a climb, so pants are suggested.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em>Do you want a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of Napa Valley and a luxurious stay in one of Napa Valley&rsquo;s premier hotels?
